-Apply pea-size amount to clean, dry skin at night.
-Start by using twice per week and gradually increase.
-Follow with moisturizer of choice after use. Add one to two drops of Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil (sold separately) for an extra boost of moisture.
-Apply sunscreen the following morning after use.

Why should I only use this at night?
Biossance recommends this serum in evening use because retinol and retinal can cause sensitivity to the sun. It is also important to wear a daily sunscreen every morning and reapply during the day.

How can I combine with other Biossance serums?
Biossance recommends using Squalane + Retinol Night Serum in the evening and choosing a day serum, like Squalane + Vitamin C Dark Spot Serum or Squalane + Copper Peptide Rapid Plumping Serum (both sold separately). Be sure to use a small, pea-size quantity of retinol when starting out, even alternating between the nights used. Since their retinol is a powerful serum, the brand doesn't recommend layering with other treatment products, but encourages you to layer with other moisturizers and oils.

-To help optimize the results of retinol, CLINIQUE suggests using it as part of a regimen with other products to fight visible signs of aging, such as:
-In AM: Use the Smart&trade; Custom-Repair Serum with the Smart&trade; SPF 15 Custom-Repair Moisturizer (each sold separately).
-In PM: Use the Smart&trade; Custom-Repair Serum + Clinique Smart Night&trade; Retinol with the Smart Clinical&trade; MD Resculpt or Revolumize or the Smart Night&trade; Custom-Repair Moisturizer for added comfort if needed (each sold separately). 

What you should know about retinol:
-Retinol is an extremely effective and powerful ingredient for anti-aging. You may experience mild redness, a warm, tingling sensation, or ﬂaking (skin exfoliation). These conditions are normal, temporary indications that the formula is working. 
-If you experience increased discomfort when using CLINIQUE Smart Night Clinical MD Multi-Dimensional Repair Treatment Retinol, revert to once every other night until skin adjusts. -This adjustment can take up to four weeks.
-First-time users and those with drier skin types may want to use CLINIQUE&rsquo;s Smart Night Clinical MD Multi-Dimensional Repair Treatment Retinol every other night for more than two weeks to give skin additional time to adjust. For added comfort, use a mild cleanser and layer an additional moisturizer over the Smart Night Clinical MD Multi-Dimensional Repair Treatment Retinol. 
-Limit sun exposure in general. Be sure to apply a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day with use and one week after stopping use of the Smart Night Clinical MD Multi-Dimensional Repair Treatment Retinol. Note that extreme weather conditions such as wind or cold may be more irritating, so take the proper precautions to protect your face.

-Prior to using the PMD, it is important to thoroughly cleanse the skin, making sure that it is free from all make up, dirt, and oils. 
-Once the skin is clean, allow it to dry completely before you begin. 
-Before using the tool on your face, practice on your arm and on your neck; these areas are not as sensitive as the face and will allow you to get used to motion and the way a treatment is performed. 
-Use the white disc first. This disc is our most sensitive disc. It is important to see how your skin responds to this disc before moving on to more abrasive discs. 
-After you have tested the unit on your arm and/or neck and feel ready to move on to your face, use a free hand to pull the skin tight in the treatment area and continue to move the PMD Personal Microderm in an upward motion across the skin. Do not make more than two passes over one area during the treatment. 
-Following the treatment, use a toner to neutralize the pH balance in the skin and a recovery moisturizer. 
-After each use, clean the cap and the disc with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial soap. 
-Wait six to seven days between treatments.

 Precautions:
-The Personal Microderm should only be used once a week. Microderm removes the top layer of dead dull skin and your body needs one week to rejuvenate. Be patient. Use it consistently and you will see results. 
-Anyone using chemical peels or products containing acids including hydroxy acids, malic acid, lactic acid, and/or retinoids or retin A ingredients must not use the Personal Microderm at the same time. This may cause skin to be too sensitive and use of the Personal Microderm is not recommended. Before it is safe to use the Personal Microderm, you must discontinue use of these products for at least seven days. 
-Consult your doctor or dermatologist if you are unsure that the Personal Microderm is suitable for your skin."

-Prior to using the PMD, it is important to thoroughly cleanse the skin, making sure that it is free from all make up, dirt, and oils. 
-Once the skin is clean, allow it to dry completely before you begin. 
-Before using the tool on your face, practice on your arm and on your neck. These areas are not as sensitive as the face and will allow you to get used to motion and the way a treatment is performed. 
-Use the white disc first. This disc is our most sensitive disc. It is important to see how your skin responds to this disc before moving on to more abrasive discs. 
-After you have tested the unit on your arm and/or neck and feel ready to move on to your face, use a free hand to pull the skin tight in the treatment area and continue to move the PMD Personal Microderm in an upward motion across the skin. Do not make more than two passes over one area during the treatment. 
-Following the treatment, use a toner to neutralize the ph balance in the skin and a recovery moisturizer. 
-After each use, clean the cap and the disc with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial soap. 
-Wait six to seven days between treatments. 

 Precautions:
-The Personal Microderm should only be used once a week. Microderm removes the top layer of dead dull skin and your body needs one week to rejuvenate. Be patient. Use it consistently and you will see results. 
-Anyone using chemical peels or products containing acids including hydroxy acids, malic acid, lactic acid, and/or retinoids or retin A ingredients must not use the Personal Microderm at the same time. This may cause skin to be too sensitive and use of the Personal Microderm is not recommended. Before it is safe to use the Personal Microderm, you must discontinue use of these products for at least seven days. 
-Consult your doctor or dermatologist if you are unsure that the Personal Microderm is suitable for your skin."

-Prior to using the PMD, it is important to thoroughly cleanse the skin, making sure that it is free from all make up, dirt, and oils. 
-Once the skin is clean, allow it to dry completely before you begin. 
-Before using the tool on your face, practice on your arm and on your neck. These areas are not as sensitive as the face and will allow you to get used to motion and the way a treatment is performed. 
-Use the white disc first. This disc is our most sensitive disc. It is important to see how your skin responds to this disc before moving on to more abrasive discs. 
-After you have tested the unit on your arm and/or neck and feel ready to move on to your face, use a free hand to pull the skin tight in the treatment area and continue to move the PMD Personal Microderm in an upward motion across the skin. Do not make more than two passes over one area during the treatment. 
-Following the treatment, use a toner to neutralize the pH balance in the skin and a recovery moisturizer. 
-After each use, clean the cap and the disc with rubbing alcohol or an antibacterial soap. 
-Wait six to seven days between treatments. 

 Precautions:
-The Personal Microderm should only be used once a week. Microderm removes the top layer of dead dull skin and your body needs one week to rejuvenate. Be patient. Use it consistently and you will see results. 
-Anyone using chemical peels or products containing acids including hydroxy acids, malic acid, lactic acid, and/or retinoids or retin A ingredients must not use the Personal Microderm at the same time. This may cause skin to be too sensitive and use of the Personal Microderm is not recommended. Before it is safe to use the Personal Microderm, you must discontinue use of these products for at least seven days. 
-Consult your doctor or dermatologist if you are unsure that the Personal Microderm is suitable for your skin."
